## Disclaimer

I'm just a junior dev who loves music and Linux. This project was built with ChatGPT's help. Lyrics are not guaranteed to be accurate ‚Äî they come from public APIs or free scrapers and may be out of sync with the actual song. Lyrics are displayed based on **song duration**, not true timestamps or word alignment.

Use at your own risk, and feel free to contribute!
